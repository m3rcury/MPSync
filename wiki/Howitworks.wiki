= Introduction =

This wiki page briefly describes how the plugin works.

I will explain the database methods, both when using triggers and when using file timestamp to do the synchronization.  The difference is mainly in the mechanism which kicks-off the synchronization as the actual synchronization process is common to both methodologies.

The thumbs synchronization is somehow straightforward and will be explained later on.


= Database Synchronization =

 * Synchronization using database triggers

This method comprises in creating a new table, *mpsync_triggers*, in every database selected for synchronization.  On every remaining table _(excluding system tables)_ inside the database, 3 triggers will be created to capture modifications on the particular table.  The change events are Insert, Update and Delete.

*mpsync_triggers* table will contain a list of tables that have been modified by their respective plugin and the time when that modification occurred.

The table has the below structure:

Below is a sample of the same table for MovingPictures database:
