= Description =

MPSync is a new process plugin that allows you to synchronize ALL your MediaPortal databases as well as thumbs from one main client onto a central location and then have any other client synchronize its database from this central location. Synchronization is done at a record level and there is no copying of whole databases. This plugin caters only for database synchronizations as it expects that all your thumbs are already stored centrally.

The settings will vary depending on the role of the client you are running the plugin on. Let us take the settings on the Master client.

== Master Setup ==

  * The client DB path should be the path where the local Mediaportal databases are located on the client.
  * The server DB path should be the path where the centralized databases are located.
  * Synchronization direction should be as in the picture, i.e. from client to server. 
  * Synchronization mode, should be "Propagate both additions and deletions".

== Client Setup ==

  * The client DB path should be the path were the local Mediaportal databases are located on the client.
  * The server DB path should be the path where the centralized databases are located.
  * Synchronization direction should be from server to client.
  * Synchronization mode, should be "Propagate both additions and deletions".

_*Same can be done for the thumbs setup.*_


Other options available are:

Synchronization direction can be set to be:
 # from source to target
 # from target to source

For these two options above, the mode can be:
 # Propagate both additions and deletions
 # Propagate additions only
 # Propagate deletions only

== Recommendation ==

When setting up for the first time, it is suggested that you backup your databases just in case you set it up incorrectly resulting in data loss.
